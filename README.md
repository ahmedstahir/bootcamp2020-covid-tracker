## COVID-19 Tracker

This is an interactive Corona Virus COVID-19 Tracker that presents data in the form of figures, map and charts. The data can be filtered to view new, recovered, fatal and critical cases and also the number of tests conducted for a given country or at the global level.

The tracker makes use of the following:
- Component-based development
- Asynchronous data fetching using `async-await`
- Material-UI with theming
- Google Maps with customizations
- [CountUp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-countup) library to apply count up transition to numbers
- [Number Format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-number-format) library to format numbers as text
- [Chart.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2) library for the ability to furnish data in an aesthetically pleasing manner

COVID-19 Tracker is available on *Surge* [at this link](http://covid-react-tracker.surge.sh/)
